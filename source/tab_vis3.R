In addition, another aspect is to calculate the ratio between them and explore the relationship between the ratio and the ratio of nutritious food intake. I consider that the intake of food nutrition is related to immunity, which in turn will affect people's resistance to COVID, so I want to explore the relationship between COVID cases and deaths and food nutrition intake, so I am doing both Before the relationship, I first choose to show the number of cases and deaths of COVID in each country to find the pattern.")
